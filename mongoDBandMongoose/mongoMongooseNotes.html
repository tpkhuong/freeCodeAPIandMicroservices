Add mongodb and mongoose to the project’s package.json. Then, require mongoose as mongoose in myApp.js. Create a .env file and add a MONGO_URI variable to it. Its value should be your MongoDB Atlas database URI. Be sure to surround the URI with single or double quotes, and remember that you can't use spaces around the = in environment variables. For example, MONGO_URI='VALUE'. When you are done, connect to the database using the following syntax:

mongoose.connect(<Your URI>, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

Create a Model
CRUD Part I - CREATE

First of all we need a Schema. Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection. It defines the shape of the documents within that collection. Schemas are building block for Models. They can be nested to create complex models, but in this case we'll keep things simple. A model allows you to create instances of your objects, called documents.

Repl.it is a real server, and in real servers the interactions with the database happen in handler functions. These functions are executed when some event happens (e.g. someone hits an endpoint on your API). We’ll follow the same approach in these exercises. The done() function is a callback that tells us that we can proceed after completing an asynchronous operation such as inserting, searching, updating, or deleting. It's following the Node convention, and should be called as done(null, data) on success, or done(err) on error.

Warning - When interacting with remote services, errors may occur!

/* Example */

const someFunc = function(done) {
  //... do something (risky) ...
  if (error) return done(error);
  done(null, result);
};

Create and Save a Record of a Model
In this challenge you will have to create and save a record of a model.

Within the createAndSavePerson function, create a document instance using the Person model constructor you built before. Pass to the constructor an object having the fields name, age, and favoriteFoods. Their types must conform to the ones in the personSchema. Then, call the method document.save() on the returned document instance. Pass to it a callback using the Node convention. This is a common pattern; all the following CRUD methods take a callback function like this as the last argument.

/* Example */

// ...
person.save(function(err, data) {
  //   ...do your stuff here...
});

Create Many Records with model.create()
Sometimes you need to create many instances of your models, e.g. when seeding a database with initial data. Model.create() takes an array of objects like [{name: 'John', ...}, {...}, ...] as the first argument, and saves them all in the db.

Use model.find() to Search Your Database
In its simplest usage, Model.find() accepts a query document (a JSON object) as the first argument, then a callback. It returns an array of matches. It supports an extremely wide range of search options. Read more in the docs.

<!-- 

Use model.findOne() to Return a Single Matching Document from Your Database
Model.findOne() behaves like Model.find(), but it returns only one document (not an array), even if there are multiple items. It is especially useful when searching by properties that you have declared as unique.
