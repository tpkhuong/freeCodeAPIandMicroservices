Add mongodb and mongoose to the project’s package.json. Then, require mongoose as mongoose in myApp.js. Create a .env file and add a MONGO_URI variable to it. Its value should be your MongoDB Atlas database URI. Be sure to surround the URI with single or double quotes, and remember that you can't use spaces around the = in environment variables. For example, MONGO_URI='VALUE'. When you are done, connect to the database using the following syntax:

mongoose.connect(<Your URI>, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

Create a Model
CRUD Part I - CREATE

First of all we need a Schema. Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection. It defines the shape of the documents within that collection. Schemas are building block for Models. They can be nested to create complex models, but in this case we'll keep things simple. A model allows you to create instances of your objects, called documents.

Repl.it is a real server, and in real servers the interactions with the database happen in handler functions. These functions are executed when some event happens (e.g. someone hits an endpoint on your API). We’ll follow the same approach in these exercises. The done() function is a callback that tells us that we can proceed after completing an asynchronous operation such as inserting, searching, updating, or deleting. It's following the Node convention, and should be called as done(null, data) on success, or done(err) on error.

Warning - When interacting with remote services, errors may occur!

/* Example */

const someFunc = function(done) {
  //... do something (risky) ...
  if (error) return done(error);
  done(null, result);
};

Create and Save a Record of a Model
In this challenge you will have to create and save a record of a model.

Within the createAndSavePerson function, create a document instance using the Person model constructor you built before. Pass to the constructor an object having the fields name, age, and favoriteFoods. Their types must conform to the ones in the personSchema. Then, call the method document.save() on the returned document instance. Pass to it a callback using the Node convention. This is a common pattern; all the following CRUD methods take a callback function like this as the last argument.

/* Example */

// ...
person.save(function(err, data) {
  //   ...do your stuff here...
});

Create Many Records with model.create()
Sometimes you need to create many instances of your models, e.g. when seeding a database with initial data. Model.create() takes an array of objects like [{name: 'John', ...}, {...}, ...] as the first argument, and saves them all in the db.

Use model.find() to Search Your Database
In its simplest usage, Model.find() accepts a query document (a JSON object) as the first argument, then a callback. It returns an array of matches. It supports an extremely wide range of search options. Read more in the docs.

  -->

<!-- 

Use model.findOne() to Return a Single Matching Document from Your Database
Model.findOne() behaves like Model.find(), but it returns only one document (not an array), even if there are multiple items. It is especially useful when searching by properties that you have declared as unique.

 -->

<!--

Use model.findById() to Search Your Database By _id
When saving a document, MongoDB automatically adds the field _id, and set it to a unique alphanumeric key. Searching by _id is an extremely frequent operation, so Mongoose provides a dedicated method for it.

   -->

<!-- 

Perform Classic Updates by Running Find, Edit, then Save
In the good old days, this was what you needed to do if you wanted to edit a document, and be able to use it somehow (e.g. sending it back in a server response). Mongoose has a dedicated updating method: Model.update(). It is bound to the low-level mongo driver. It can bulk-edit many documents matching certain criteria, but it doesn’t send back the updated document, only a 'status' message. Furthermore, it makes model validations difficult, because it just directly calls the mongo driver.

 -->

<!-- 

Perform New Updates on a Document Using model.findOneAndUpdate()
Recent versions of Mongoose have methods to simplify documents updating. Some more advanced features (i.e. pre/post hooks, validation) behave differently with this approach, so the classic method is still useful in many situations. findByIdAndUpdate() can be used when searching by id.
findOneAndUpdate uses ( conditions , update , options , callback ) as arguments.

Hint 3
Don’t forget the use new option to return the updated document.
  -->

<!-- 

Delete One Document Using model.findByIdAndRemove
findByIdAndRemove and findOneAndRemove are like the previous update methods. They pass the removed document to the db. As usual, use the function argument personId as the search key.

   -->

<!-- 
Delete Many Documents with model.remove()
Model.remove() is useful to delete all the documents matching given criteria.


Note: The Model.remove() doesn’t return the deleted document, but a JSON object containing the outcome of the operation, and the number of items affected. Don’t forget to pass it to the done() callback, since we use it in tests.
    -->

<!-- 

Chain Search Query Helpers to Narrow Search Results
If you don’t pass the callback as the last argument to Model.find() (or to the other search methods), the query is not executed. You can store the query in a variable for later use. This kind of object enables you to build up a query using chaining syntax. The actual db search is executed when you finally chain the method .exec(). You always need to pass your callback to this last method. There are many query helpers, here we'll use the most commonly used.
